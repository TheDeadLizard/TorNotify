#TorNotify

Bash script that could show public IP every X minutes. Default set to 5


How I ended up with this?

Known issue? I was using ubuntu while creating the script, for now it wont work on Kali because Kali do not support notify-osd. 
Will find a solution and update soon. 

Need help with any of the above? Post a comment @ http://www.anonymity.guru/tor-notify/
